# Data-Scraping
This project is basically on scraping investment details of Foreign Institutional Investor(FII) on Indian market.

I have used python and mysqldb for this.

I gathered historical data from "http://www.moneycontrol.com/stocks/marketstats/fii_dii_activity/" pulled out gross purchase and gross sales coloums from 2012-till date and stored data in database.

Uploaded my first project on github. Hope you will like it.
